The old sylladex used a literal deck of cards with a holographic table. While *very cool*, this has usability issues, since you need space to lay everything out and to throw the deck.

The new sylladex is a digital interface on an arm-mounted holographic device. This allows us to use literal cartridges again, while having a compact and still-vaguely-diagetic inventory.

Cards may be interacted with as if they were physical objects, and may actually be pulled out and enlarged into physical cards. The same applies for putting cards in.

Captchaloguing an item involves either aiming at or holding an item and pressing the captchalouge button. This marks it with an outline until fetch modus requirements are completed. Once the fetch modi are satisfied, the captcha'd object is shrunk down and placed inside a card, which then moves to its appropriate position in the deck.
