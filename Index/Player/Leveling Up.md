On every echeladder rung and every god tier, the player gains stat points to put into a variety of stats.

Every so often, an echeladder rung (but not god tiers) grants a perk, which is a powerful game-changing synergistic bonus.

Performing actions contextually increases performing that action in that context. For example, grinding a certain type of spell against an imp spawner increases that spell's effectiveness against swarmers, but not commanders.

Perks may also be granted based on ways the player changes the game, eg. earning a reputation that changes how NPCs interact with them. Permakilling players always grants perks. This is done via the [[Kiddie Camper Handysash]]

Available stats and perks are determined by the existing build.

Leveling up also grants strife specibus affinity points, separate to stat points.
