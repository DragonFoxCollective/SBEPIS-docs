A tag holds arbitrary data about any items able to be capchalogued. Tags can be created through the [[Bit|Bits]] and [[Bitset|Bitsets]] contained in a given item, or the relations that these things have to each other, but can also be inherited through item card data, the item actually contained inside of a given card. As an example a [[Perfectly Generic Object]] has no bits, but have a "Green" tag, which can be inherited to objects combined with a [[Perfectly Generic Object|PGO]] via alchemy. 

Tags may also contain information relating the the original item base, so the base items in larger [[Alchemy Trees]] can alter and influence stages of [[Alchemy]]. Tags can be oppositional or synergistic, showing when they cancel each other out, exist in binary states or come together into emergent tags. Tags also contain a history of items used in the creation of a given item, which will be used to heavily influence the outputs to discourage players from using alchemical loops. I.E. Combining the same objects together infinitely to create wildly different forms without the use of other tools
