An Alchemy Tree is a history of the items needed to create various items, allowing players to use the same items attained in different contexts in order to create the same end result. It also serves to prevent players abusing alchemy to grind for stat increases without intentionality. Additionally, these can be used to effectively check a "family tree" of a given item in order to allow for mathematic operations to have more points of reference for how items may change when a [[Bit]] is added or removed.

%%Adding this as I see it being able to REALLY interact with [[Ectobiology]] and the [[Body System]] as a crafting system, treating this history as almost a genetic family tree, like the crafting system suggested by ??Kag?? (I assume as it was through Jady's mic and a bit quiet to tell).%%
