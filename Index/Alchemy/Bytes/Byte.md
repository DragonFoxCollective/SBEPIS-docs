A Byte is a type of information stored in items that describes the appearances, stats, bonuses and synergy focused abilities items are able to contain. Bytes exist on a scale of 0-100, with the number of a correlating to the stat progression of alchemised items, the aesthetic leaning of an object in regards to which [[Part]] pools it pulls from, and broadly properties of an item that would not be form defining in nature. Vectors also define physical properties of objects in synergistic ways, such as weight or density. This will mean Vectors in combination with [[Bit|Bits]] will comprise key functions within the physics system. Each tag has its own grist cost, with the upper limit cost corresponding with a magnitude of 100.

Bytes have a total range of 0-255, and are unable to expand beyond this total without reducing an existing Byte.

This list is an in-progress list of Bytes that have been planned for [[SBEPIS]]. %%Currently containing minimal examples. Will use this page as a point of reference for grist types to describe stuff to BEGIN alignment with canon, but we'll likely only follow it as much as we need to.

| Tag            | Description                                               | Grist Type |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| [[Dersite]]    | Derse Culture. Facism, War, Poverty, Crime                |            |
| [[Prospitian]] | Prospit Culture. Religion, Faith, Fealty, Post.           |            |
| [[Midnight]]   | The Midnight Crew. Crime, Mafias, Casinos, Assassination. |            |
| [[Dreamer]]    | Dream Moon and Carapacian Commonground.                   |            |
Bytes should cover a broad topic of aesthetics that can cover all [[Bit|Bits]] and when reasonable, [[Bitset|Bitsets]]. This means that a Byte should not be so specific it can only cover a single item, but rather much more broadly a theming for objects. For example, Grimdark would be appropriate, Fans would not. (This is of course excluding if you were to make a society of fan people who have a civilisation based around fans broadly.)

Bytes each should have a pool of parts and items describing at least majority if not all [[Bit|Bits]], a handful of [[Bitset|Bitsets]] and [[Material|Materials]] available to objects in a given Byte. This means items with a combination of Bytes will use a mix of [[Part|Parts]] and [[Material|Materials]] to create the end results of alchemy. 

Due to this Bytes play a major role in generating [[Civilisations]] in [[Land Generation]] and [[Cultures]] in the [[Politics System]]. The goal being to create a clear in for [[Modded Content]] to effect the base game visually and mechanically, without requiring frameworks to be rebuilt entirely.
