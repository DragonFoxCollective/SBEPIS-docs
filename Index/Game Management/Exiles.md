Exiles are player profile characters, representing the ability to interface with menus that cannot be made part of a diegetic experience. Their appearance is customisable, [[Carapacians]] by default, with their appearance being used to create a player profile icon for the sake of multiplayer. They feature important stories inside of the [[Questing]] and [[Storytelling]] systems in any given [[Session]], an [[Unresolved Death]] is of an exile is effectively a [[Doomed Timeline]] as their life is a requirement for a [[Session]] to have a [[Stable Timeline]]. 

Players can gain ways to modify the appearance of their Exiles in the [[Multiplayer Lobby]], by exploring the pre-built desert and ruins of the lobby to find pieces clothing and decoration or by completing [[Achievements]] in the [[Advancement Database]] and equipping them via the [[Wardrobifier]].
