Session Player's are a role underneath [[Session Master]] able to access terminals if allowed by [[Session Master]]. Players without access to terminals are considered spectators, only able to view events via their terminals. During setup, players are able to view settings being changed by a session master and "suggest" settings, this will be shown as a marker by settings with a tally to show how the groups preferences lean. When votes are split, a [[Session Master]] must override the choices to pick settings, but all players are notified when their votes are overridden. Players inside of their [[Command Station]] are able to use a terminal to use a chatbox feature, this also allows for OOC chat when in game proper textually.

Session players are not bound to a single character, able to play characters bound to any [[Command Terminal]] they are granted access to by other players or [[Session Master]], this is shown via Barcode scanner granting or denying access to specific terminals.
