This page is a Work In Progress and needs to be expanded on. Information is up to date, but incomplete. #WIP #Current 

In SBEPIS majority of the UI and gamification is diegetic to players, however, some menus require the use of more traditional forms of UI to present this information with ease and clarity across control schemes. [[Exiles]] act as the bridge to make more traditional UI and game elements diegetic, such as game setup, multiplayer lobbies, and in game information tracking that doesn't make sense to show in the base game without alterations.

This page will not showcase all the ways [[Exiles]], [[Command Station|Command Stations]] and [[Command Terminal|Command Terminals]] are used for this, but rather how game management is handled specifically, covering save management, multiplayer connections, settings menus, game setup and session moderation broadly.
## The Main Menu

The main menu boots with a Skaianet loading sequence starting with the player picking their system language. A camera begins to load from the view of a [[Sentry Worm]], vision is meant to replicate a low quality camera in a digital interface, with data readouts and the like to show it loading up after detecting life in the dead world. When the camera turns on, the sentry worm is burrowing through sand before poking up to the surface and looking at the [[Command Station]] bound to the player's system. It's shape is determined by customisation options, randomly picked on a first load until altered by players. 

The [[Sentry Worm|Sentry Worm's]] body is visible moving away from the camera and connecting into the [[Command Station]], it looks around scanning the landscape briefly and showing a readout of an incoming superheated sandstorm. Reload will not replay this scene, instead choosing to flicker the camera onto the menu options immediately. 

The menu options will load, as text on the left side of the screen, their names are tonal in nature but if hovered over will show a textbox clarifying what they do to prevent confusion. The following options are shown, Germinate Session, Join Session, Advancement Database, Settings, About System, End Connection. 

When the game boots, the player's exile profile cannot be seen. There is a day night sequence here, linked to the player's system time, with basic weather animations and scene movement for interest. Small random events may occur too, tattered fabric blowing past, a heavy sandstorm briefly occurring, basic weather and the occasional shooting star from a [[Skaian Portal]].
### Germinate Session

Geminate Session will have the following readout when hovering over the option:

This option begins a new game, allowing you to take on the role of [[Session Master]] or [[Session Player]], connect to a group and decide your session parameters before you start play. [[Session Master|Session Masters]] will moderate and determine the [[Session Settings]], if you would like to have multiple [[Session Master|Session Masters]] you will need to start by having secondary [[Session Master|Session Masters]] join as players and promote them in game after setup. 

Upon clicking the option for the first time, the ground will shudder, with text readouts stating "Superheated Sandstorm: Incoming. Predetermined Exile Approaching.". The [[Sentry Worm|Sentry Worm's]] camera will shift away from the [[Command Station]] towards a sandstorm in the distance, with focus indicators boxing around a dot on the horizon. "Potential Match: Seek Visualisation" will appear beside the box and the camera will zoom and focus on the figure, showing a shadowed [[Exiles|Exile]] in the sands. 

Here, a player will see an [[Exiles|Exile]] randomly generated from available options, before allowing the player to customise their [[Exiles|Exile's]] details such as their name, dream moon, and job as well as their general appearance. This will be saved for the sake of making NPCs based on the [[Exiles]] that can appear in [[SBURB]]. A player's [[Exiles|Exile]] name is not the same as their [[Player ID]], the [[Player ID]] is a string of letters and numbers which creates a unique barcode pattern for their system. 

The [[Sentry Worm|Sentry Worm's]] camera will zoom in as the figure is obscured by sand. "Visualisation Unconfirmed: Seek Callibration. System Warning - Power Low: Backup Available on Connection. New Task: Provide Entry to Unconfirmed Exile - Allow Calibration to Access Backup Power - Terminate Exile if not Predetermined ID" The following text shows before a hatch on the front of the [[Command Station]] opens up and the camera fizzes out as the sandstorm picks up. 

This transfers the camera to the first person view where the [[Exiles|Exile]] will approach the Station, entering into the hatch and scanning the QR Barcode on their person in order to confirm their identity. This both locks them in safe from the sandstorm and opens up the rest of the facility. At this point control is given to the player to move around the inside of [[Command Station]] as the [[Exiles|Exile]] in order to complete setup.

This process will default to the previously designed [[Exiles|Exile]] for future instances. Cutscene will have a shorter version with the option to skip entirely for players looking to get right into play. 

From here, the paths diverge depending on if [[Session Player]] or [[Session Master]] was selected from the main menu.

#### Session Master 

As the player picked to be the initial [[Session Master]] their initial room will a monitor available to them, the first when interacted with asks for basic calibration allowing the player to alter settings to intended values, I.E, control preference, graphics, audio, ect. Other options can be placed into this terminal. Once complete the monitor confirms the player understands that their role as [[Session Master]] is to moderate the other players and set up the ruleset that will [[Germination|Germinate]] their [[Session]]. Upon agreeing, two new menus will become available. 

One of the menus handles connections, allowing players to connect to each other, with moderation tools available to the [[Session Master]] such as kicking, muting, disallowing various actions and direct messaging other players but also setting up passwords and whitelists to allow players into the session at all. (**!**%%This is mostly here as I'm not sure what is/isn't possible with how we're setting up multiplayer. If this is wrong, talk me through how we need to have this and I'll rework it.%%) 

One of the menus handles basic [[Session Settings]], but players seeking more complex and fine control can activate the advance terminals, which will open up panelling unique to the [[Session Master|Session Master's]] [[Command Station]], each terminal is themed over each of the types of settings players wish to expand on, combat, difficulty, timelines and story-beats, custom content allowance, ect. 

After settings are decided, each player has the option to accept the given [[Session Settings]], though a [[Session Master]] will be given an option to override, which all players will be announced about. This effectively allows a session master to have final say in the starting settings available to a given session. It is of note that Germinating a session for Lord and Muse characters will only be made available to a player completing the game once and will likely have a different sequence involved entirely.

After accepting this, all [[Command Station|Command Stations]] will mobilise to the [[Frog Temple]] ruins of the destroyed world. The [[Session Master]] will also get a message stating that Germination is begining, that to finalise and begin a session, they will need to retrieve a seed from the [[Frog Temple]] in order to connect the [[Time Capsule]] to it's linked [[Command Terminal|Command Terminals]] in a [[Stable Timeloop]]. 

This is a short task all players have together to give them a chance to communicate in the lobby, finalised by the [[Session Master]] to mark the end of set up, locking in the [[Exiles]] appearances for use in play and letting players have one last chance to talk about alterations to [[Session Settings]] they may want. This quest consistes of taking a seed from the [[Lotus Flower]] of the [[Time Capsule]] back to the [[Session Master|Session Master's]] [[Command Station]], where session settings will be injected into the seed, and the seed sent to the frog temple's conception in paradox space with all information stored inside for relevant [[Time Capsule]] releases.

After this, [[Session Settings]] will no longer be available to the players, but the terminals will remain for the sake of promoting players to the role of [[Session Master]] and [[Moderation]] broadly.
