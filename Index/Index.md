Welcome to the SBEPIS documentation!

SBEPIS is a fan-made, first-person implementation of "SBURB," the game from Andrew Hussie's web comic _Homestuck_. The goal of SBEPIS's development is to complete several hard tasks that other SBURB sims haven't done, such as comprehensive AI and procedural alchemy.

SBEPIS is a traditional roguelike, adventure, immersive simulation game. "Traditional roguelike" in this case means having 20 hour runs that might end due to any mistake and having to learn over many many instances.

SBEPIS is in _Pre-Alpha_ and _does not_ have a timeline for full release. Information within the documentation is not exhaustive and is subject to change at any point.
