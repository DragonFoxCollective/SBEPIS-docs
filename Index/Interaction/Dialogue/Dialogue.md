The dialogue system uses the [[Roleplay]] system to generate text based on NPCs' personalities and potential responses based on the players' personalities.

Emotional or objective context may be changed by using the [[Combat#Stances|Stance Wheel]] prior to engaging in dialogue.

Dialogue is also a critical part of [[Combat]], as sometimes it is better to peacefully resolve a dispute, but also you can use it to shout commands to your teammates or NPC cohorts.
