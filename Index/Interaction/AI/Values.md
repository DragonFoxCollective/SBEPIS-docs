TLDR a hand-made neural network.
# Personal Values
Various traits that an agent possesses, like how Jack likes stabbing people, Leave No Witnesses, freedom, finding a hot dame.
# Knowledge-seeking behavior
This includes using devices that have information about other things, like fenestrated planes (which are just more agents?).
# Taste
Agents love and hate different tags.
# Pecking Order
Jack must follow the Queen.
# Loyalty
How willing an agent is to follow another agent. Jack betrays the Queen.
# Relationships
Jack and the Queen hate each other (/sex). See how she forces him to wear the dumb hat.
# Culture
Carapacian culture is dictated by prototypings. Relies on the masses. But also it includes things like how Dersites hate the frog and Prospitians worship it.
# Faction Values
Values set by a faction's leaders.
# Faction Goals
Internal personal political system values. Jack's hit-list, for instance, as well as wanting the Midnight Crew to operate and be big and successful, as in Spades Slick.
# Causality / Situational Awareness
Receiving information is influenced by other Values, which may then change other Values (such as Emotion).
# Emotion
The main Value that causes agents to not work totally logically. Easily swayed.
# Relevance
An agent's tendency to perform large-scale actions.
# Survival
Things an agent needs to survive.
# Object Reputation
Knowledge about things like artifacts. May invoke emotions and enable following through on plans. Artifacts may also have to be tested if they seem powerful.
# Responsibilities
Jobs to do within the political system. Jack has to do paperwork, but also one of his personal values is that he hates paperwork (a peon's job), decreasing his loyalty further.
# Contentedness
Willingness to remain in the current situation.
# Tedium
An inverse factor of Contentedness.
# Other Random Session Factors (???)
Karkat gave the universe cancer, which is likely what caused Jack to become the Sovereign Slayer and blow up Skaia and stuff. Destructive impulses and murderous tendencies.
