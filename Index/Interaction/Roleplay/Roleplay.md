Named after the [Roleplay System](https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/685537) from [SBURB Glitch FAQ](https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/551606), the roleplay system both grasps each player character's identity and ensures that the players play according to the characters they've created.

For example, the system determines that a character should be a knight of life based on NPC interactions and playstyle. From this, their life-based spells such as healing or sapping are more effective in combat and less effective elsewhere.

For another example, a player harmfully exploits consorts (either in or out of character). Because of this, the consorts will start to distrust the player and will be more hostile, requiring the player to earn back favor.

The roleplay system ties in nicely with the [[Values|AI]] system.

# [[Dialogue]]

[[Dialogue]] is one way to understand what the player's character is like.

# Playstyle

# Dream Journaling

Another way to glean information about a player's character is directly receiving their inner monologue. We are doing this by providing a diary, or "dream journal", to players in their dream towers, which they must complete in order to wake up. The dream journal uses the [[Dialogue]] system to have the player recap events that have transpired and provide their feelings on them.
