Motifs are the spell components. Starting with a certain motifs makes that music phrase be that spell.

Playing things that aren't motifs increases a number in the spell. Casting spells that require specific large numbers is long and hard, so representing specific locations can be done by unlocking certain motifs for game-centric locations (like the battlefield), through imbuing data into sentimental items, or something like picking up a rock and later recalling where that rock originally was.

Motifs get an effectiveness bonus if they're played within the right octave, and another if they're played in the right key in any octave.

Playing a motif, followed by playing that motif in a higher octave stores data in that motifs register. Anyone playing in that musical sequence can later recall that data by playing that motif, followed by that motif in a lower octave.

Since this is a base-1 counting system, using certain math operators against multiple number literals is not allowed. No multiplying 10 by 10 to get 100.

Although playing a recorded spell in combat works just on a keypress, it still has an interrupt time until the spell is fully casted.
