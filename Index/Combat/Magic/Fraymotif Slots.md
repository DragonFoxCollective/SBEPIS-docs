Fraymotifs (spells) have their own slots in the strife portfolio. Each slot type corresponds to some type of recording medium, eg. records, CDs, tapes, sheet music, etc. Each type provides a different casting effectiveness buff based on spell type, like offensive, defensive, or utility. Media may be placed in differing slots, but will lose their casting bonus. Players only get one type they must pick, similar to strife specibi. Players can assign fraymotifs with a dukebox.

Dungeon rewards may include clean casting media or etched media for a slot type the given player doesn't have, but shops will always have etched media for the correct slot type.

Some media may be transcribed to another format through another alchemy machine.

Media may be found in rarer forms that can contain more music.

The type of media determines certain mechanics of the spell. Media with multiple sides gives it a togglable state into a different spell that can be flipped in spells or manually in the dukebox. Media that plays on loop allows for recurrent casting.

# Dukebox
The dukebox (jukebox) allows players to store and switch out their spells. It is similar to the sylladex in terms of diagesis, and can be placed in-world to play music from the media. It also contains discovered music from their session's OST.

The final tier dukebox upgrade is an mp3 player that may provide all casting bonuses with no limitations.
