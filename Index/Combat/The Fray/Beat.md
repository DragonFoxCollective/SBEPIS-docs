A Beat is a unit of time representing one turn of [[Combat]]. Actions and dialogue (called "[[Note|Notes]]") have a length of time in [[Beat|Beats]]. Lengths of Beats themselves are dependent on the [[Tempo]] and [[Time Signature]] of a particular combatant. Combatants will TEND to fight On-Rhythm unless fighting reactively or attempting to throw an opponent [[The Fray#Fighting Off-Rhythm|Off-Rhythm]].
