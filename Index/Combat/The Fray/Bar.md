A Bar is a unit of time representing one round of [[Combat]], comprised of a number of [[Beat|Beats]] based on a [[Time Signature]]. [[Ability]] cooldowns finish as Bars end. [[The Fray]] can be exchanged between actors at the end of a Bar. This is also when AIs may change behaviors.

[[Dialogue]] as a whole follows a pattern over Bars, even if saying lines are appropriate as Beats.
