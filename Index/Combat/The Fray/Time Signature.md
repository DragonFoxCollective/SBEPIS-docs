The Time Signature is the number of [[Beat|Beats]] in a combatant's [[Bar]]. Having a larger Time Signature generally implies a faster [[Tempo]].

Multiple Time Signatures may exist in the Fray simultaneously, resulting in [[The Fray#Polyrhythms|Polyrhythms]].

The denominator of the Time Signature is always 4, meaning Beats are always counted as quarter notes.
