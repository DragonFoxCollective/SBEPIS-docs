The Tempo is the speed of a combatant's [[Beat|Beats]] and [[Bar|Bars]]. It is paced by the strongest fighter(s) as they own the [[The Fray|Fray]]. Desperation, intensity, difficulty, and proximity to an [[Event Chunk]] all correlate positively with Tempo. Tempo can also be increased during arguments, chases, or escapes.
