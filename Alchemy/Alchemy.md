Alchemy is STUPID!!!

In SBEPIS, items are stored within item cards. Items have identifiers correlating to when a player “discovered” the recipe.

# [[Bit|Bits]]

An item card contains bits, defined by any of 48 holes punched in the card, and tags, defined by the qualities of the item stored inside the card. A card with no holes always contains a Perfectly Generic Object, or PGO. Bits contain information about an item’s basic function or type, such as the Handled(H) bit, which denotes an item with a component able to be wielded by players.

## [[Bit#Bit Sets|Bit Sets]]

Some bit combinations add emergent tags.

# [[Tag|Tags]]

Tags, contained within item cards, correspond to qualities about an item. These can be defined through bits (called bit tags), but also through item card data. For instance, a PGO has no bits, and thus no bit tags, but does have the Green tag, which can be inherited. Tags may also contain information relating to the original item base. Tags can be oppositional or synergistic. There may only be a certain number of tags on an item at once. Tags retain memories of what created that item, discouraging alchemical loops.

## [[Tag#Aesthetic Tag|Aesthetic Tags]]

Other than bit tags are aesthetic tags, which, unlike bit tags, have a scale from 0 - 100 that determines how strongly an item inherits the traits associated with the tag. When two items are combined, the averages of tags is calculated, rounding down into whole numbers. Alchemizing an item with an item in its hereditary tree returns the same tag value. The more prominent a tag is, the more parts might be exchanged. Tags have aesthetic and form components, and perhaps materials affect things like weight and buoyancy, although minorly. As a tag gets higher or stronger, it gains secondary abilities, such as damage increases. Aspect tags are the important parts of this. Aspect tags will give an item an aspect power when strong enough.
