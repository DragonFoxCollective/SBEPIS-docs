The players continuously find strife cards. The strife portfolio only allows a certain number of strife cards to be equipped. Leveling up gives the player affinity points that they can use to increase the affinity of a certain card. Affinity unlocks contextual alterations to that weapon type, along with damage increases.

Weapons stored in strife specibi can be pulled out of the weapon wheel, instead of having to use the sylladex.

The first strife card can be freely picked, and immediately grants special perks that cannot be granted through affinity, allowing for immediate choice in build along with weapon.
